  This small modification makes almost all indoor floorings equally beautiful as smoothed stone. The exception is wood floor, because it is very easy to build. Instead, I added parquet floor which is harder to build and costs more than twice the resources.

Changes:  
   Adjusted beauty of vaniila floors
     - wood floor: from 0 to 2
     - stone tile: from 2 to 3
     - carpet: from 2 to 3

   Added a new floor type:
     - parquet: requires 8 wood and 1200 work, has 3 beauty

   2017/02/07:
   To offset the increased beauty-value of wood planks, I've decided to increase their cost:
	 - from 3 to 5 wood
	 - from 85 to 400 work

   The parquet floor was created using a set of wood textures from:
